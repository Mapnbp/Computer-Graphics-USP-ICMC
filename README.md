# ðŸ’» Computer Graphics
This repository is dedicated to the study and practice of the fundamental concepts of Computer Graphics, covering everything from basic principles and classic algorithms to more advanced rendering topics.

This repository explores the core principles of computer graphics, from fundamental algorithms and geometric transformations to advanced rendering techniques, shading models, and antialiasing.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
The main objective is to provide a solid foundation in Computer Graphics, familiarizing students with the concepts, algorithms, and practical applications of the area. This repository will serve as a guide and an environment for implementing and experimenting with the topics covered.

## ðŸ“š Course Content
Below is a list of the topics that will be explored in this project:

### Fundamentals
- Origin and Goals: The history and objectives of Computer Graphics.

- Graphics Devices: The differences between Vector and Raster devices, as well as the main input and output devices.

- Systems and Equipment: An overview of the graphical systems and equipment used in the field.
